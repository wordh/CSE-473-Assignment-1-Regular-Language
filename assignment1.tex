ANSWER TO QUESTION 1(a)

The DFA accepts all the  Binary Strings that ends with 1.

The DFA accepts strings for example 01, 001, 00101, 00111, 1, 111

The DFA Rejects all the strings as 010, 0010, 10, 0, 001110, 1110

ANSWER TO QUESTION 1(b)


The DFA accepts all the Strings that takes a, b , c as input and contains ba as substring.

The DFA accepts strings for example abcbbaa, abac, cbab, cbcbbac

The DFA Rejects all the strings as abbc, abcaabc, abcbb, abccbb
